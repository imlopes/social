This module allows to respond telegram chats as a telegram bot.

This way, a group of users can respond customers or any other set
of partners in an integrated way.

It is not intended to be integrated on default chatter as users don't need
to review again when one has responded.

Configuration
=============

Create the bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create a Bot on telegram https://core.telegram.org/bots
2. Create a broker following the examples on
   https://github.com/tegin/telegram-broker with the TOKEN provided


Configure Odoo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Access on debug mode
2. Access `Settings > Technical Settings > Email > Mail Broker`.
3. Create a bot and assign the token. Mark it as `Show on App`
4. Press on `Generate webhook` in order to Open the webhook

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Webhook functionality can only be used if your system is accessible from website.
On local installations it might be problematic as Telegram will not be able to contact
your system. In that case, you might need to create a telegram bot that will send data
to you on an external process with the following code.

.. code-block:: python

    from telegram.ext import Filters, MessageHandler, Updater
    import requests
    dp = Updater(YOUR_TOKEN)

    def message_callback(update, _context):
        requests.post(YOUR_CONTROLLER, json=update.to_dict())


    dp.dispatcher.add_handler(MessageHandler(Filters.all, message_callback))
    dp.start_polling()
    dp.idle()

Usage
=====

1. Access `Broker`
2. Wait until someone starts a conversation with your bot.
3. Now you will be able to respond and receive messages to this person.
